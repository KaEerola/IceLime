# Retrospective

## Sprint2

Mad:
- Some functionalty took time because there was always a little error in application

Sad:
- Dividing the work equalily was a bit complicated 

Glad:
- Every our task fo the sprint was done
- Time managament was good and we didn't have any rush

## Sprint3

Mad:
- Pylint

Sad:
- Error that took too long to fix, in the end the fix was very simple
- Some of us worked over 6 hours

Glad:
- Everyone was independent, but we communicated well
- We completed all of our tasks
- We were able to get difficult functionalities work

In the end, we were able to fix our Pylint errors and get everything to work the way we intended it to.
We started to check and fix Pylint errors as they appeared, instead of fixing the errors right before pushing to GitHub.
As the sprints went on, we improved on writing more descriptive commit messages.
